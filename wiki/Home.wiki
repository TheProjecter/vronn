No comments yet. If you check the sources, you will see three single .ml files which are in fact two versions of the neural network itself. We will create separate working directories and expand the thing when we will start with the sound recognition process itself.

*29 Sept 2007*

To do list :
 - Fix the network so it can learn while having more than one layer.
 - Find a bunch of sound files. (only have got the alphabet at the moment, which is good enough for a start)
 - Look for a model to output what letter it recognized with a couple of figures
 - Get started with fftw (it works, I've been told, never seen the result though)
 - And when everything is ready, make lots and lots of tests !
